Query: Norwegian Wood
Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami is a literary fiction novel set in 1960s Tokyo, blending elements of romance, coming-of-age, 
and psychological drama. It follows Toru Watanabe, a young university student, as he navigates complex relationships with two 
womenâ€”Naoko, a fragile woman dealing with grief, and Midori, a lively and independent character. 
The novel explores themes of love, loss, mental illness, and the search for identity, with a melancholic and introspective tone 
that captures the emotional complexities of youth and the impact of personal trauma.
